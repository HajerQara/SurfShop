SurfShop.cpp:
Johnny Utah owns a surf shop on the beach called “Point Break Surf Shop”. 
Johnny sells surfboards in 3 three sizes: small (2 meters), medium (3 meters), and large (4 meters). 
The cost of one small surfboard is $175.00, one medium is $190.00, and one large is $200.00.  
Write a program that will make the surf shop operational.  

Your program should allow the user to do the following:
    1) Buy any surfboard in any size and in any quanity.
    2) At any time show the total number of surfboards of each size sold.
    3) At any time show the total money made.
